# Rust
Rewrite of the classic lunar lander game in Rust

This was based on on the Python version I created.  I wanted to write something small
in Rust, and that project was fresh in my mind.

## Known issues

- It's not very good Rust, as this is a first pass

- It could use some refactoring, particularly to split up run_game() ~~and
make the input code a separate function~~ Done

- Most of the same issues as the Python version

## Future work

Well...
