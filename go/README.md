# Go

This is my Go version of lunar lander.  I used the Rust version as a reference,
but made a few changes to account for differences in how the languages work.

The executable in the 'bin' directory should work as is, to build from source it
is necessary to set GOPATH to the directory that contains the 'src' directory.
