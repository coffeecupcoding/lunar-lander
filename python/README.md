# Python

This is my Python version of lunar lander.  See the top-level README for
general information.



## Some known issues with this code:

- It's not very Pythonic

- There are no options to set initial parameters, and the intro text uses
static values

- The overall design is not particularly consistent internally

- There may be differences in calculation due to different implementations
of floating point numbers

- There are no unit tests (NASA would not sign off on this code)

- There are likely bugs (in edge cases, of course)

- It likely uses more memory than any computer had at the time the original
was written
