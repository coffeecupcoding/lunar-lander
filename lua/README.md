# lua-lander.lua

I did a very quick (< 1 hour, including learning some Lua), semi-automatic
'transliteration' of the BASIC code into Lua,
as something of a joke (goto's are a necessary part of Lua, so I went with
that)...  the output formatting is bad but it works!  This also helped me
identify a significant bug with the Python and Rust versions, so it was
worthwhile.  It's the same length as the original BASIC version, but I moved
the subroutines to the beginning to satisfy the Lua interpreter.
